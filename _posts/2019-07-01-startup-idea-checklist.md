YC上有一篇关于创业想法的[checklist](https://www.defmacro.org/2019/03/26/startup-checklist.html)，还有[相关评论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20254057)，mark一下。

some notes:
1. Usually it's best to find a narrow set of users who have this problem and explore around the problem to get a better picture of it. This can often lead to a different product solving a more key problem.
2. Scaling is less than worthless if what you're scaling is worthless.
3. [Why toys?](https://blog.ycombinator.com/why-toys/)
